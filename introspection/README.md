INTROSPECTION :

Why must we choose you?

Honestly i am very interested in CSE fields but i wasted my first 2 years due to my laziness now i realized my mistakes and i want to grow in my interested field.

What is your plan for the next 6 months?

To acquire knowledge in CSE fields as much i can and developing skills in problem solving and coding (basically i am very poor in coding)


How would you contribute back to the club?

to implement all my knowledge in to help to make club better

Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

i think this selection process is great . eventhough may some one enters club or not by doing these tasks i can bet that individual definetly gains some knowledge
